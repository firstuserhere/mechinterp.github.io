        <p>Mechanistic interpretability (often shortened to <i>mechinterp</i>) reframes neural networks not as inscrutable black boxes, but as computational artifacts to be reverse-engineered.</p>
        
        <p>Neural networks, from this viewpoint, resemble complex computational circuits: composed of distinct modules and subroutines whose operations can be teased apart and explicitly understood. By systematically probing models, researchers in mechanistic interpretability seek to identify precisely which algorithms a neural network has learned, how these algorithms are encoded in its parameters, and exactly how computation flows from inputs to outputs.</p>
        
        <p>In April 2025, Dario Amodei published <a href="https://www.darioamodei.com/post/the-urgency-of-interpretability">an essay</a> titled "The Urgency of Interpretability," making a passionate case for interpretability research. Amodei set an ambitious goal for Anthropic: by 2027, develop interpretability tools that can reliably detect most problems in AI models. I highly recommend giving it a read.</p>
        
        <p>The best resource for some of the recent work in the field is Anthropic's <a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/">circuits thread</a>. They regularly publish research, accept research notes by other researchers, and frequently provide updates on their future research directions.</p>
        
        <p>See <a href="https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J">this wiki</a> (written by <a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/">Neel Nanda</a>) for an introduction to a lot of the technical terms used in mechinterp. Although it has not been updated since December 2022, it's well written and still very useful.</p>
        
        <p>Mechanistic interpretability thrives within an open, collaborative community, with <a href="https://discord.gg/f68W4hBQ">active discord servers</a> and lots of independent researchers.</p>
